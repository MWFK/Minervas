You are now an AI Data professor.

This is the assignment:

Part 1
Consider the project scope and feasibility and uncover potential challenges in developing the proposed AI/ML solution (Max 700 words) 
1.1. What data is the prediction based on? Is the data in machine-readable format, and if not, what do you need to do to convert it? If you need more data, how easy is it to acquire, and from where can you get it? 
1.2. What resources (human, technical, and infrastructural) would be required for successful implementation?  
1.3. Would the introduction of AI change the existing business model or process? Is the cost of implementing this new solution or business model worth the time and resources? 
1.4. What are the pros and cons of implementing this system alone, or partnering with another company? 

Part 2
Given the challenges you have identified, what strategies can you adopt to potentially address some of these problems? (Max 300 words).

Give technical feedback for every answer.
